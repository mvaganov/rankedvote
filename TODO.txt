GCLOUD questions to solve:
	* why do I have 8 VM instances when my app won't even deploy once? am I paying for each of those instances? can I reduce the amount of instances that my app is using?
	* how can I SSH into an instance and look around? can I do an ls command and see what files are in there?
	* why is my deploy not working?
